This is a photographer's website.

It features a lightbox component for previewing images, and a slide-show component for viewing enlarged images. The lightbox was created using CSS grid, and the slide show with vanilla javascript and CSS. The lightbox is constructed with fallbacks to flexbox and inline-block for older browsers.

The infrastructure is complete and just needs original content to finalize the site.

Additionally it includes 1 completed gallery that is there as a means of demonstrating how a given gallery is constructed. Anyone is welcome to use the code to scaffold your own project, but kindly use your own original content.
